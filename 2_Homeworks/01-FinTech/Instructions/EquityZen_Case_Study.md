## <div align="center"> Overview and Origin



[**EquityZen Securities LLC**](https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/281820) is a registered broker dealer offering investments in privately held technology companies via [*SEC Reg D*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulationd.asp) to accredited investors. Founded May 1, 2013 by Atish Dava, Shriram Bhashyam, and Phil Haslett in New York City as part of the [*500 Startups*](https://500.co/) accelerator program, which provided the intitial funding in 2014. Since its beginning, the company has attracted the attention of notortious angel investors such as [*Timothy Cook Draper*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Draper).  As of April 2020 the company has received approximately $13.5 million in external funding through seed rounds and equity series offers. 

 The sources of funding the company has attracted along with the timing of its incorporation (being  just over one year after the  [*Jump Start Our Busniess Starups Act*
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumpstart_Our_Business_Startups_Act) (JOBS Act)
was signed into law in early 2012) gives resonable evidence of how the idea of the business came to fruition.  The JOBS Act loosened SEC regulations allowing small businesses to raise capital through equity offerings without having to go through SEC registration. This posed a new opportunity for early-stage investors, employees, venture capitalist, and institutional investors of maturing start-up ventures to sell their pre-IPO shares to the public via alternative investment methods such as [*crowdfunding*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crowdfunding.asp).  In doing so, it provided the possibility of early access for retail investors wanting exposure to the potential returns these rising stars might offer. The only thing missing was the medium for the procurement of the shares.

EquityZen Securities LLC operates under the trade name [**EQUITYZEN**](https://equityzen.com/).

EquityZen touts its success in providing liquidy to otherwise illiquid equity for the holders, while similatiously advoiding negative effects to the company's captialization table.  Using it's derivative infrastructure, shares are placed in a [*special-purpose entity*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special-purpose_entity) LLC allowing the transfer of economic rights without haveing to transfer legal ownership. Retail accreditted investors are then able to buy and sell ownership interest in the SPE LLC.

Three investment options are offered to investors: Direct Share Aquisition, Multi Company funds, and Single Company Funds.  Where Direct Share Aquisition is common among competitors, Multi Company Funds and Single Company Funds are unique to EquityZen and set it apart.  Through the use of funds investors, otherwise lacking the minimum investment requirement to do Direct Aquisition, can pool share orders together to meet the requirement. The shares held in the fund are fully vested stock, not options.  Thus, this EquityZen market share access to many small accredited investors its competitors lack.

## <div align="center">Landscape
EquityZen ,broadly speaking, operates in the [Alternative Investment](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alternative_investment.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways-,An%20alternative%20investment%20is%20a%20financial%20asset%20that%20does%20not,all%20examples%20of%20alternative%20investments)
 fintech domain which is characterized by  investments which do not belong to any of the three conventional investment catagories e.g. stocks (of publically traded companies), bonds, and cash. Examples of alternative investments are: commodities, privet equity, venture captial, real estate, hedge funds, cyptocurrency, ect.  Crowdfunding is a more recent developement in the domain, which creates a [primary market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/primarymarket.asp#:~:text=The%20primary%20market%20is%20where,example%20of%20a%20primary%20market) that offers a large number of investors the opportunity to invest in startups.  EquityZen offers a service akin to crowdfunding, but instead creates a [secondary market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/secondarymarket.asp#:~:text=The%20secondary%20market%20is%20where,when%20they%20are%20first%20issued.) to offer late-stage pre-IPO investment and trading. 
 
 Within last decade alternative finance has experienced major disruptions due to changes in monetary policy of central banks, the evolution of blockchain, deregulation of privet equity offerings, technological innovations, and increased ease of access by consumers to information and technology.  These trends have lowered the barrier of entry for small fintech startups to perform on the same levels as the larger, more experienced institutions. They have provided more diversified investment options for the average consumer. EquityZen has used these disruptions to its advantage to acheive a level of success that rivals peers such as [Forge, SharePost and Carta](https://www.harnesswealth.com/articles/selling-your-startup-shares-comparison-secondary-stock-marketplaces/).

## <div align="center">Results

 EquityZen and its peers have dramatically transformed the the privet equity market. Evidence suggests that by having easier access to capital through these new channels, companies are, on average, remaininig  privet for longer periods.  Business models like that of EquityZen might incentivize more early investors by potentially reducing the time between the purchase and sell of the equity.  Further more, a company may be able to better understand the level of public demand if it were comptemplating an IPO. 

 To perform well in the Alternative Investment Fintech Domain it takes a few key charateristics.  Fist and formost is transparency. Since alternative investments are not regulated the same as traditional investments, lack of information on an a company or about interested investor can be a big deturrant. EquityZen's model of working closely with the issuer to ensure the shares are offered in a manner that meets expectations.  For investors, EquityZen ensures any information an inverstor would need to make an informed investment desicion is available, while also offering ownership interest in single security funds and direct aquistions.  Diversity of investment is another key driver of success.  Though, EquityZen falls short in this area, it has been able to overcome this obstical by offering a much lower minimum intitial investment than its competitors through the use of pooled funds.  EquityZen has heavily intergrated technology to set itself a part from the pack. For example, it was one of the first to provide investors with the ability to submitt privet equity transactions electronically. Unfortunately, two of it main competitors, Forge and SharePost, have recently merged to create the largest electronic privet equity market in the world. This will undoubtedly cause trouble for EquityZen in the future.

## <div align="center">Recommendations

EquityZen should focus its efforts on continuing to develope its service to "smaller" accredited investors throug .  Though, the return maybe smaller per investor, there is not much competition in this market demographic for privet equity at this scale.  Next, EquityZen would probably do well for it self if it diversified in to new industries and sectors.They already have the tools and knoweledge needed to move in this direction since it would be a latteral move. It would potentially attract more investors by adding diversity to its investment options. Their expertise in privet equity could be applied launch a new type of crowd funding platform for companies in the early to middle stages of developement. EquityZen could create multi-layered special-purpose entities that could allow non-accredited investors to access to the current investment options.  Finally, since it already practices the art separtating economic rights from direct ownership, it could possibly take advantage of the features of  blockchain to increase efficiency and security in process.
